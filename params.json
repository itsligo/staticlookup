Only those **Cities** not already in the collection are added.\r\nHow the program decides whether the **City** is already in the collection is important here.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier version, we used **String** for holding each City (i.e. just the name of the **City**) which meant we could use the **.Contains()** member of the **List&lt;T&gt;** class to see if the **City** were present already.\r\nHowever, this later version which uses a proper class, **City**, to hold both the name and population means **Contains()** won't work - see the code for details.\r\n\r\nThere are several solutions which are explored in the code.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
